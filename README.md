## üìñ Introduction

The ***Rapido Ride Data Analysis Projects*** aim to analyze the Operational Efficiency and Financial performance of Rapido, a popular ride-sharing Service.
These Projects focus on:
* Understanding Ride completion rates and cancellation patterns.
* Identifying high-revenue Service types and destinations.
* Exploring Payment methods and user behavior to optimize Revenue streams.

The Power BI Project provides interactive dashboards for visualizing key trends, while the SQL Project uses complex queries to uncover insights into ride performance and distance metrics.

## üìä Dataset Overview
The dataset includes the following key columns:

* **Ride Status:**  Indicates whether a ride was completed or cancelled.                                                                    
* **Service Type:**  Categories like bike, auto, cab, etc.                                                                        
* **Distance:**   Distance traveled during the ride.                                                                  
* **Ride Charges:**   Total fare for each ride.                                           
* **Payment Method:**   Paytm, GPay, Amazon Pay, QR scan, etc.                            
* **Date:**   Ride timestamps for time-based analysis.

## üíª How to Run the Projects

### 1. Power BI Project:
1). Open the "Rapido_Ride_Project(PDF).pdf" (or ".pbix" if available) using Power BI Desktop.                       
2). Explore the pre-built dashboards to gain insights into ride volume, payment methods, and service types.            

### 2. SQL Project:
1). Import the "Rapido_Project(SQL).sql" file into your SQL environment (e.g., MySQL Workbench, SQL Server).              
2). Execute the queries to create views such as "Successful_Ride", "Average_Distance", and "Ride_Status_Ratio".           
3). Analyze the output to gain insights into ride completion rates, average distances, and cancellations.
